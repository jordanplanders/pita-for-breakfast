## Day 3

Hi all,

“Why are you awake at 5:11 a.m.?” You ask? Very fair question. “Because on top of the chorus (kind term for it) of roosters, at 5 a.m. there was a cacophony of ten minute calls to prayer from every mosque in Giza over loud speaker”

Day 3 found us with grand intentions of getting up and out by 7:30 to beat the crowds too, but functional plans to enjoy our breakfast on the enclosed roof terrace of our hotel (similar spread as with Gail, though less charming), amassing our gear and getting out the door in time to be on the trail (foregoing the “salami sandwich” this time) by 8:15 prevailed.  Not bad—we missed most of the large tour groups from the day before—but not the empty Treasury we had thought might be coming our way. C’est la vie; what do you gain, what do you lose? 11 miles and 30 minutes.  I’ll take it.

We were on a mission to see the Roman tombs.  It went something like this: scramble down the path to the treasury, head to the right to the tombs, scramble up a first round of stairs. Oh my, what a view. <br>

Scramble up more stairs to a tomb. Good heavens, did you see that ceiling?! (It looked like some sort of highly textured weaving, though in fairness it’s not super obvious looking at the picture that it’s a ceiling.)

Discuss the potential value of several small objects with stall owner, conclude we don’t like him or his prices. Walk past half a dozen more stalls. Climb more stairs. Man, did you see that view behind us?

(The views behind us were of the main road spilling out past the amphitheater toward the mountains (I’m not sure what constitutes a mountain to be honest, but these were notably less gentle than hills and required hiking to get into, so we’ll go with it for now) where the monastery is. The layers of rock and all their texture alone would have been notable, and  adding the various structures carved into the rock made the view that much more intricate.) Did you see the texture in the rock steps?

Thank goodness they didn’t deem it necessary to throw concrete over those like they did a few a ways down—traction be damned, beauty for the win! (We believe, in an effort to increase traction for tourists where steps had been eroded by years of wear and wind and water, some tourist organization added a concrete layer to the top) Climb more stairs. (Noticing a pattern?) Oh, now we’re getting somewhere... sigh, photo?

Scramble... etc At this point, I encourage you to look at the photos.  I will only add that (1) we saw a full sized Pepsi cooler abandoned at the top of the mountain and can’t imagine how it came to be there and (2) we saw two guys with a donkey hauling four bags of trash and the donkey was weaving across the path back and forth, occasionally scraping one of the bags against the rocks

and Kevin had me in fits anthropomorphizing it—ask him about it sometime. We did a little shopping during our scramble down and out of Petra, but mostly we were on a mission to get in the car and off to Wadi Rum, so we will pick up our story there...
<br><br><br>

We only got stopped once by the police on our way to Wadi Rum (valley of light, airborne sand)! We were running a bit late, so by the time we arrived we were in a rush, but it still ended up being a wild exciting ride of an afternoon.  Where you ask, were we headed, really?  Right, so Wadi Rum is a nature preserve in the south of Jordan not far from the Saudi Arabian border.  On our drive to Wadi Musa from Amman, at the recommendation of enough random people, we decided to cancel our second night at the Rocky Mountain Hotel in Wadi Musa and opt to make the 2 hour drive south to take a 2 ish hour Jeep ride through the preserve, a 2 ish hour ride on camel and a night in a tent at a Bedouin camp.  (I’ll give credit where credit is due though, it was Gail who did the dirty work of cancelling our second night at the hotel and made arrangements for our tours and stay at Khaled’s Camp—have I mentioned that she was great?) We scrambled a bit, trying to make sure we ended up with the right people (Gail said we shouldn’t advertise who we were looking for in case they offered to be whomever we named), but soon we were in the right Jeep (for some loose definition of Jeep—I believe it was actually a Toyota) and off on Mr. Toad’s wild ride.

What an experience... You’ll see some pictures of each of us with hair flying back as we sped along (the young guy driving was very skilled) and I’ll tell you that I probably took an order of magnitude more pictures than survived due to the uneven terrain ;) But to add a few extra words, it was, an expanse.  This wide open space of subtly varying red sand topography punctuated by sandstone outcroppings in the hours just before sunset.  We would stop every so often to scramble (our young intrepid driver as tickled by my name being Jordan and would send us off with, “Go Jordan! GO!”) up some rock for a view or to view some old inscription on some rock (in truth, the view from the ground wasn’t that different from the view from the top  because it was all of a huge expanse and a 100 feet of vertical doesn’t move the needle on your perspective much, but the scrambles were fun in their own rights) but my favorite part was the ride :) We did eventually make it to the spot our driver had in mind for the sunset and after s few unannounced and unexplained stops—literally he stopped without explanation, reversed, smiled, parked, but didn’t beckon us—to gather pieces of brush and rocks, it became clear that the sunset watching plan involved Bedouin tea. We still don’t understand why he chose to make the fire on the other side of the vehicle from the sunset such that we couldn’t drink tea while we sun go down, but as it turns out he struggled with the fire starting anyway (resourceful fellow though, eventually pulled a little gasoline from the car to help things along) so sunset and tea happened sequentially anyway.

You’ll see the picture of our tent, but the important thing to know was that one wall of it was window so we could look out of our bed where we were under a pile of blankets and see the stars. Our dinner was cooked underground, so just prior to dinner we saw chicken, potatoes, vegetable stew, and rice emerge from the ground on a multi level set of trays. (Not only was dinner delicious, but bonus for Jordan-the-vegetable-enthusiast was the lovely cucumber and tomato salad and the yogurt cucumber sauce :)) After dinner we sat around taking with the other guests (two couples from Bavaria traveling separately, a woman from San Francisco, and a fellow who works in the UAE with plans to retire soon with his kids and grandkids outside of Boulder) and took a wander to look at the stars.

That’s a wrap for now, time to head back to sleep (hopefully).
