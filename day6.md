## Day 6 
Tl;dr: we walked 10.5 miles and both left and safely returned to our hotel with quite a day of Cairo in the interim.

In case you do want to read however, here goes...

We woke up at 3 to the sound of roosters.
We woke up at 4 to the sound of roosters.
We woke up at 5 to the sound of roosters... and the call to morning prayer coming from multiple audiologically conflicting mosques simultaneously.  The cacophony went on a solid 15 minutes.  There are people in this town with nontrivial lung capacity.
Stayed awake to more roosters... and a duck!  (We envisioned all of them standing facing Mecca)
Drifted but woke up at 6:20 to more roosters and Kevin’s alarm so that we could go watch the rising sun spill light across the pyramids.  It ended up being beautiful (though highly filtered by the pollution that hangs over Cairo), albeit cold, and we found out that the roosters and duck (actually, ducks, it turned out there were more that had apparently held their peace earlier), and a goat were actually on nearby rooftops, which may explain the volume we experienced in our third floor room.  (Incidentally, the rooms are numbered from high to low, so our room on the third floor was 103.) The sun soundly up, we went back our room and enjoyed lovely warm showers (hot water has not been as available here as it is at home) and headed back up to the roof to enjoy breakfast with a view.  (Incidentally the roosters were still going.  We’re thinking it’s an “it’s sunrise somewhere” mentality...)

We caught an Uber from  the Chinese restaurant to the subway station and managed to procure two train tickets (25 cents each from a guy at a window—there are no automatic kiosks so everyone without a monthly pass of some kind has to stand in line).  Happily it was the end of the line so hard to go the wrong direction, and we crowded into the car.  So many men.  For the Milner family, Jaden might offer that there was “too much boys!”.  I felt a bit conspicous without a head covering... right, and being blond haired and blue eyed, but I kept my head mostly down just in case and Kevin kept me close and some time later we arrived at the Egyptian Museum without incident.

We spent a couple-few hours wandering—let’s call it wading—through Egyptian aritfacts.  The place is everything people say it is: impressive, densely packed with objects that are mostly unlabeled, and when one happens to be, the label is quite literal with no particular context and was produced on a type writer, and filled with tourists. Let’s go back to the impressive part for a moment though because it deserves mention that we saw Tutankhamen’s head piece in a glass case in the middle of a room that we almost missed and it really is impressive.  We also saw a number of mummies which was interesting, though made me a bit queasy to be honest.

After perusing the Egyptian Museum, we walked down the Nile across a bridge and back over to train station. It was only a loop, but fun to be able to say we’ve seen the Nile!

Back to tales of food... After our Nile detour, we undertook crossing Tahrir Square... which is to say we opted to go through security and back into the subway passages in order to cross the street.  Heh.  We made our way to  a restaurant called Koshari El Tahrir that was recommended by a friend Kevin made at the workshop he attended in Saudi Arabia prior to (and the impetuous for) our trip.  I don’t think I’ve ever been to a restaurant where the only choice is do you want “small”, “medium”, or “large”.  But here we were. For $1.50, we got two small (and small constituted a very reasonable lunch portion) bowls of a pasta-rice combination with a tomato sauce and lentils and fried onions (I neatly dodged them, though not the onions in the dish—c’est la vie) with hot sauce.  Delicious.

So we talked about the challenges of traveling by Uber, but after lunch we tried our hand (feet?) at walking around.  There aren’t really crosswalks, and not many lights, so (given traffic) you cross the street by weaving through slowly moving (sometimes even stopped cars).  It felt a little like being in a video game, weaving among vendors and sidewalk shops, crossing streets with some sort of meditative fluidity (and a fair dose of courage).

I do want to say that Kevin was awesome all day.  At one point I was thanking him for watching my back and making sure I was safe, and I will paraphrase slightly, but basically his response was, “well, I try to remember that the experience that a small, blond, blue eyed female is having may be less comfortable than my own.” Seriously, he was right there all the way and I felt the freedom to look around a bit and make eye contact with the women I saw from time to time and take in the sites as we wizzed by (we tend to walk fast).

On our way to the Bazar we navigated small streets, big streets, side streets, small markets in the middle of intersections and a stretch of women’s clothing that was stall after stall  on a pedestrian street for at least half a mile. Clothes were hanging above us several dresses high and piled up on tables in front of store fronts (the stores were very shallows so most of the business happens on the walkway). Upon arrival, we wandered the bazar for a while, poking our heads in places to look at leather slippers and silver jewelry, several types of scarves and mother of pearl inlaid boxes.  What we didn’t do was take too many pictures so you’ll have to trust us on this one mostly.  Neat scene though, and once we were there we both felt much more at ease, so we were able to enjoy it, despite all the people trying to get our attention.

We paused outside Al-Hussein Mosque for a bit to collect ourselves and then made our way to Al-Azhar Park.  What a relief it was to walk through the greenery and spend time under trees; for a bit less than a dollar each we found respite from the madness of Cairo. We shared a couple of ice cream bars and roamed. Per the usual, nothing was that simple though. It started with one. A woman walked up to us and asked if we would be in a picture with her. Surprised, but happy to help, we agreed. Then a little ways down the path we’re approached by a group of girls, each of whom it seemed wanted a picture or two either taken by a friend or as a selfie, some solo and some as a gaggle. We stopped on a hill to look out and finish our ice creams and continued wandering. I would guess that we took north of 20 photos    with probably two dozen kids who approached us from the front, the back, the back running around in front of us—we developed a finely honed sense for the approach of children.

I’ve learned that the promise of unlimited 2G data is limited to a small selection of areas with outdated networks. This hasn’t been s huge deal, but in Cairo we have leaned on Uber and were trying to meet up with an acquaintance of Kevin’s from KAUST, so I’ve been running around looking for old 3G network like one might use a Geiger counter to characterize radiation. Long story short, 3G didn’t come through for us in the park and we were left with getting s cab to take us to the train station. Of course the cab got going the wrong way/long way and only because of Kevin’s fanatical perusing and some very forceful words did we end up at a, but also not quite the right, subway station. Regardless, we found the right train and rode to the transfer station. I’ll pause here to say that this account wouldn’t be complete if I didn’t mention that a random guy on the train first moved over to give me a space by the handrail, but then also reached out when I wasn’t looking and started feeling my butt. It took me s minute to realize what was happening (it was a crowded train) and then to glare at him and shortly thereafter book it off the train. Kevin was possibly more appalled than I was (I guess some part of me was mentally prepared? Ugh), but gentle and protective and concerned in a way that did help with the feeling of being violated.

We made it to Maaudi where we met Hany and enjoyed quite a spread of classic Egyptian dishes and stories of his family and the village where he grew up (and invited us to visit). After dinner we popped down the street for sugar cane juice and then back to the train.

In keeping with the search for 3G, we got off at Giza, realized the network was updated, and took the train to the end of the line where I thought I had found some 3G in the morning. Success! Well, kind of. I was able to call an Uber, we were able to cross the street, but—just our luck—the driver didn’t know how to use the Uber app. Oy. We scrambled around trying to find s place in the map written in Arabic so that he could know where he was going (our trusty Chinese Restaurant did not come through for us on this one).

Anyway, we did eventually make it home, so tomorrow will be another day.
