Tales of our trip to Jordan and Egypt


## Day 1
Hi all,  

In the spirit of the Scotland emails, here’s the newest from the travel log...  

What a place... (we’ll start there and I’ll back it up with some words and a few pictures that vaguely do it justice). 

A few notes about airplane travel:  
If you fly into O’Hare and land in, say, terminal 2, and need to get to terminal 5, you will need to run—and I mean run— to gate C17 and hope that the bus will be arriving soon enough to give you enough time to cross the tarmac. If this is not the case, the lady will unapologetically tell you that “you are going to miss your flight.” Happily I was on one of the few flights with timing such that I squeaked by with 15 minutes to spare having /booked it/ from the bus to the gate. Anyway...  

I did make all my flights (LA-Chicago-Vienna-Amman) and through immigration and found Kevin waiting at the bottom of the escalator to give me a big hug (also, points to him for explaining literally every part of the process of going through immigration). We eventually found our way to the rental car company, were given a Nissan Sunny (not nearly so friendly as little Argo from Scotland) with considerably less hassle than in Scotland, and hit the road.  

You’ll see from the pictures that lane lines are a flexible topic here. Take moment to try to parse what they might mean. (Our host last night informed us that people drive in the lanes...unless the shoulder is paved better, and then they drive there instead.) Once upon a time there was an improv comedy show called “Who’s line is it anyway?” With a tag phrase “where the rules are made up and the points don’t matter.” We (mostly Kevin’s creative genius) came up with “Who’s lane is it anyways? Where the police stop you randomly and the lines don’t matter.” Ever the trooper, Kevin did the lane juggle and 2.5 hours later he and my jet lagged self arrived at our Airbnb.  

We made a game-time decision to try to get Petra by Night tickets, so within the hour we were off again hunting an ATM, dinner and tickets. Wins all around and we chowed down on sandwiches as we walked toward Petra for the first time.  

Magical. With the path was lit in both sides with luminaria (candies sitting in sand inside bags—makes for glowing bags) and a big of a moon, we made our way through the canyon toward the Treasury. I’ll admit we were not quite, but almost, the last ones there because I was fumbling with lenses and camera settings (in the dark!) trying to capture some of it, but made it we did. We sat there under the stars listening to first a guy playing a really old bowed string instrument I can’t remember the name of, and then a flutist. After the concert they lit up the Treasury. When we walked in the entire area in front was doted with the luminaria but the spots of light on the ground didn’t illuminate the actual carving well. Anyway, have a look at the pictures, that will do it more justice than I can.  

That wraps up my first fraction of a day in Jordan.  

As usual, I’m a day behind, but The Short Version of today is: our Airbnb host was amazing, hiking Petra was literally an awesome (as in, inspired awe) 11 mile experience (I’m exhausted—bone tired from hiking and jet lag), and dinner at the Airbnb host’s husband’s restaurant was delicious and delightful—he is also a notably gracious host.  

I may send stories from today tomorrow, but they may just get wrapped into picture captions. (I’m a little behind posting pictures too, but here’s where they’ll be:
