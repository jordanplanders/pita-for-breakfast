Tales of our trip to Jordan and Egypt


## Day 7

Last one for this trip! You’re in the home stretch!

We woke up at 1:42 a.m. to try check in for our flights from Cairo to Moscow and Moscow to JFK/LAX (J/K respectively) and were met with an error message saying we weren’t allowed to because our initial departure airport was Cairo. Right, “so what?” you ask? It’s southwest style and we weren’t allowed to choose seats in advance, so we were left in suspense all day wondering if we would both have middle seats for s 1:45 a.m. flight. A key part of surviving our flight combinations had been that Kevin would sleep on the window, and I would sleep on Kevin, so this added some bonus anxiety about surviving serious exhaustion as well as some grumpiness about having woken up unnecessarily at 1:42 a.m.. Boffo!

We only briefly woke up at 5 to the call for prayers and the roosters (I, for one, had earplugs this time around, and Kevin usually sleeps with a pillow over his head and the combination was more effective on this occasion than the prior) and properly woke up at 6:45 to shower, pack, and eat so that we could be out and dodging people hiring themselves out as guides at the pyramids entrance by 8:20. Having seen the pyramids several times from the guest house rooftop, we were familiar with the site, but as we walked up, it was still jarring how big they are. There are a few JFS (Jordan-for-scale) pictures as well as plenty of each of us with them, but just consider that each block came up a bit above my waist when I was standing against them and they are MANY blocks high.

We sort of accidentally (and sort of not accidentally) let a guy take pictures of us (who we then of course had to tip), but the pictures were good—if a bit cheesy—so in the end it seemed worth it. For a few bucks we also got to go in and take pictures of the inside of one of the smaller pyramids. I don’t think we got a picture of the ladder, but it was some long boards backing some cross rungs and you kind of lowered yourself into this chute one step at a time with each hand on a well worn banister because there were only about three feet (maybe fewer?) of clearance so no option for standing up. Back up the ladder, we tipped the guy who had let us in (as we had known we would have to), but then another guy looked at us expectantly, so he got a dollar as well. (Shout out to the guy in my yoga class who I had never met—surprising given how rarely we get new comers—who overheard me talking and told me to bring plenty of $1 bills for tipping in Egypt. Without that intel we would have had a very different experience.)

Once more into the wide open world, we wandered over to the largest pyramid and I think were only intercepted by one group of school children and one pair of camels (one gawked at us, one was gawked at by us). We walked around taking pictures and admiring the construction. The parallel-ness of the edges when you line up the sequence of pyramids is very pleasing, as is the way the lines are simultaneously clean but the sides textured.

You’ll see the pictures, if you haven’t already (and eventually google will let me upload mine...maybe), but the next hour or so was a combination of taking in the size of the pyramids, the perspective, the way the light played the geometry, dodging and agreeing to be in photos with groups of girls, and moseying through the sequence and toward the road going up the sand dune that offers a view of all three together with Cairo in the background.

However, we did take a detour to one of the small adjacent pyramids where the rocks were smaller because Kevin has a hankering to climb. Climbing was not ideal for me with my many layers and my big camera (thank goodness I got the neoprene wrap for it), but not to be left behind, I clambered yo behind him. We were just about st the top and I had snagged a couple of pictures of Kevin when we heard people starting to yell. Right, so it wasn’t exactly kosher that we were climbing. This pyramids wasn’t roped off like the others, but we were pushing the rules a fair ways to have tried to take to the sky on this one. So we clambered down. The tourist police gave us a real runaround and yelled at us and insisted we delete any pictures. I showed them as I deleted photos from my camera, hoping I might buffer anything Kevin had snapped on his phone and deflected enough that we walked away only down my pictures, and hearts racing. The guys softened up a bit as we asked a couple more questions about how to get places, but still, definitely walked away with hearts racing. Bummer that after all that Kevin only got a couple of selfies of himself that don’t really show the pyramid and no vague evidence at all that I was there, but it’s good we didn’t get into any more trouble than that.

We made our way up that road to the sand dune behind to take our side shots and then made our way down for a look at the Sphinx. I should have counted the number of photos we took with kids, because our way down was thick with them. Eventually I tapped out because my patience had been sapped by the police encounter. Kevin entertainer a few more, but after a quick look at the Sphinx from behind a gate, we arrived at the bottom of our hill, tour complete.

Now for the open question of what to do with our afternoon. It was a conundrum because there isn’t much to do in Giza outside the pyramids, but there also isn’t really a “casual jaunt” version of “visiting Cairo after the pyramids” that we had been able to find. We ended up burning the afternoon chasing WiFi and lurking in the hotel. At some point it started raining sporadically and got cold, at some point we ventured out for a snack, but mostly we moved between lurking in the room by the entryway, the roof deck (uncovered though, so not ideal), and the stairwell (until we got the WiFi password for downstairs). I caught up on these emails a bit, we both fought with google photos, Kevin learned about the Moscow airport, and eventually we shared another bad beer (at this point we speculated that it may bd the worst beer in Cairo, but possibly also the best beer in Cairo, and also the only beer we had ever seen with Arabic writing on it) on the roof, changed and headed out.

So Day 6 night was supposed to include a Nile dinner cruise, but after the no-data/no-Uber fiasco turned into s logistical nightmare, we scrapped that plan in favor of postponing the dinner cruise for Day 7 night when we would have time to kill and no place to kill it. So we arrived at the dinner cruise at 6:49 without a reservation for a 7:45 cruise, bags in hand. This seemed to be an unusual situation for them, but they actually took it quite well. I think Kevin got a little more rigor, but the guy who pawed through my bags did so very gingerly (I think he didn’t want to risk encountering a foreign woman’s underwear—not in his job description of checking purses and cell phones and running a metal detector). I waited with the bags in the increasing drizzle (the dinner cruise is inside) while Kevin successfully procured tickets and then they graciously arranged for us to board early do we wouldn’t have to sit in the rain and found us a place in the corner (it was perfect—we could see everything in the room but had more window access and a ledge where we could store our bags!).

Amusingly, the meal was almost over by the time we left the dock. Meal was meh, to be honest, but the excursion had guaranteed us a warm, dry place to be for three hours and something to eat, so we’ll give the memorably horrible chocolate cake a by. We did encounter some much more decent Egyptian beer which was both good, but also meant we could laugh about the other beer being the worst and possibly the best ;) the dinner entertainment included some singers and a belly dancer and a whirling dervish of sorts (I believe) and by 10:10 we were back at the dock. Importantly, having decided that perhaps we could extend the list of places we are willing to travel to to include those with ducks in addition to those with sheep (a thesis that came from our trip to Scotland).

The rain has gotten very intense st points during our float on the Nile and we were pleased to find it relatively abated by the time we disembarked. We got a guy in the office to let us use his phone as a mobile hotspot to call an Uber and headed upstairs. We eventually found the car but having lost the connection prior to locating the car (mobile hotspot still with the guy in the office) when we got in the car we ended up having to operate outside the Uber infrastructure and pay the guy way more than we should have (though less than LA and about half his asking price—$50?? Ha!).

It didn’t turn out to be a horrible ordeal, but our not-Uber dropped us at the wrong terminal and we briefly thought we were going to have to pay another person a small amount of money to take us where we needed to go. But as usual, Kevin was scouring google maps and gave us enough confidence that terminal 2 was nearby that we skipped the tourist tax and walked.

At this point Kevin had begun laughing nonspecifically about the madness that is Cairo and chuckled that every new hiccup was a conspiracy against me because it meant more words in this email.

Well, let me tell you that I just went through security for the third time. Once to get to check-in (water was allowed through that one and electronics didn’t have to be removed), again after immigration (special line for Moscow in which they tore apart all of our bags and we sat in a forest of metal detector plastic boxes repacking the clown car of a duffel that contains 90% of our souvenirs and some dirty laundry to pad it) and a third time before the gate (there were six people—four men, two women—taking apart bags, swiping electronics and humans for explosives residue and doing pat downs/metal detection wanding). I think that will be all, but what’s an extra few more security checks between friends?

A couple of final addendums:
I should mention that metal detectors are everywhere, not just the airport in Egypt. We came across them going into museums, hotels, the subway...they are variably staffed and attended to, but the infra structure is there.

I will probably steer clear of Aeroflot in the future. The Moscow airport was actually pleasant enough, and happily we did not have to go through several more rounds of security, but both flights left late for reasons that were not explained (and non-negligible late: 40 and 60 minutes respectively), the movie selection was mostly unrecognizable, the food was notably bad, and there wasn’t any alcohol on the plane. It’s not do much that wine on planes is delicious, but rather having a glass of wine lends an air of bonus civility that makes me feel less like part of a cattle herd (which makes the comment about “steering clear” ever more apt).  The leg room is a little bit more than average though, so that’s compelling, and the flight wasn’t full, which is always good.

That wraps it up for this trip! I’ll be landing in JFK shortly and Kevin in LA a few hours later. Kevin will of course play a gig tonight (because he’s crazy), and I’ll see my folks with my dad flying in  tomorrow and the three of us trooping over to see the new Harry Potter plays on Saturday (part 1 and 2). I’m back next Wednesday (meeting up with Kevin and some other earth scientist friends in DC for a couple of days at an annual conference prior to return), and hope to see you all around soon!
