Tales of our trip to Jordan and Egypt


## Day 1
Hi all,  

In the spirit of the Scotland emails, here’s the newest from the travel log...  

What a place... (we’ll start there and I’ll back it up with some words and a few pictures that vaguely do it justice). 

A few notes about airplane travel:  
If you fly into O’Hare and land in, say, terminal 2, and need to get to terminal 5, you will need to run—and I mean run— to gate C17 and hope that the bus will be arriving soon enough to give you enough time to cross the tarmac. If this is not the case, the lady will unapologetically tell you that “you are going to miss your flight.” Happily I was on one of the few flights with timing such that I squeaked by with 15 minutes to spare having /booked it/ from the bus to the gate. Anyway...  

I did make all my flights (LA-Chicago-Vienna-Amman) and through immigration and found Kevin waiting at the bottom of the escalator to give me a big hug (also, points to him for explaining literally every part of the process of going through immigration). We eventually found our way to the rental car company, were given a Nissan Sunny (not nearly so friendly as little Argo from Scotland) with considerably less hassle than in Scotland, and hit the road.

You’ll see from the pictures that lane lines are a flexible topic here. Take moment to try to parse what they might mean. (Our host last night informed us that people drive in the lanes...unless the shoulder is paved better, and then they drive there instead.) Once upon a time there was an improv comedy show called “Who’s line is it anyway?” With a tag phrase “where the rules are made up and the points don’t matter.” We (mostly Kevin’s creative genius) came up with “Who’s lane is it anyways? Where the police stop you randomly and the lines don’t matter.” Ever the trooper, Kevin did the lane juggle and 2.5 hours later he and my jet lagged self arrived at our Airbnb.  

We made a game-time decision to try to get Petra by Night tickets, so within the hour we were off again hunting an ATM, dinner and tickets. Wins all around and we chowed down on sandwiches as we walked toward Petra for the first time.  

Magical. <img alt="mars landscape" align="left" src="https://lh3.googleusercontent.com/uD2yK9S9HXhpzGxB3HWjyT4ONlkBnQw-bVP6ErY-rJb37Xdh_BDUqTn68fmosQWe9w6Mxq63NJRMV-owXPhK8s2PBeRfA7GqGF3uqA_qbxBDnqphMPXGycFl6ZX_69HSIFzFsNc-wcDslzZA3FDfV_ZYCztkwPhiOMnJs05vwEeQ0chXDKKIUSuBV65LDP7XLhB8S0ItevC0mxJ5CNYQ0g6s2Jak6WtV3ubujc8lcxX9E2RVCf3q2LeOmFSgJVG0N_L_chcJrhTBBmcTUXb4noZFcjk9201h2rlIuOfJ0L_qmY4AXK_ccNSczpYOm0bL8viLhVczCLKW5yKg700ADZmIUnLUbMYt86lfiBrWM2i31eQsaKGKoLGU34RbRpvyia8VmbKMS1xJGhxyOsK-Qg5GoHGCEOJF3Gg-4lUcU8-n1WHYSR5WbvJpj-0Xk5STj6YbCFr_rHGGjs54iajvqGNZpDhojynrVYiYj8KL7ky5gI9ja2X3u6vym5EKjWyJRn4dxYHHwJA5a0szd__jHdyf0VnIMT5te8Hj5JhVmyiFq9q0Z5nDP-iRC_bR5ajhGJpjB9xld792BwdyAHteWM465qV32V0IV3T8rW6xC9aleUQNn8RIObAwGapXNWNl3b3i3tbQj3zgAgRqgxbVUoPtbj4cYZxghfVcII8QquWXOuIUvALMS2cRuV05Q0IlBCeHcHsv5fhlMPvUWO8=w2186-h1458-no" height = "225">

I’ll admit we were not quite, but almost, the last ones there because I was fumbling with lenses and camera settings (in the dark!) trying to capture some of it, but made it we did. When we walked in the entire area in front was doted with the luminaria but the spots of light on the ground didn’t illuminate the actual carving well.

We sat there under the stars listening to first a guy playing a really old bowed string instrument I can’t remember the name of, and then a flutist. After the concert they lit up the Treasury... Anyway, have a look at the pictures, that will do it more justice than I can.

That wraps up my first fraction of a day in Jordan.  

As usual, I’m a day behind, but The Short Version of today is: our Airbnb host was amazing, hiking Petra was literally an awesome (as in, inspired awe) 11 mile experience (I’m exhausted—bone tired from hiking and jet lag), and dinner at the Airbnb host’s husband’s restaurant was delicious and delightful—he is also a notably gracious host.  

I may send stories from today tomorrow, but they may just get wrapped into picture captions. (I’m a little behind posting pictures too, but here’s where they’ll be:

(Scroll down until you get past Kevin’s Saudi Arabia pictures from his work trip to get to Jordan pictures.). 

Hugs from Jordan,  
Jordan

## Day 2
Dear world,

Last we spoke I had given you the tldr on day two... which could be mostly explained by the fact that Friday was spent hiking 11 miles on a brain full of adrenaline and jet lag. Let’s see if we can do it more justice than that.

Day 2
Mmmmmm breakfast here is great :) Yogurt and apricot jam, za’atar and labneh and pita, cucumbers, tomatoes, eggs, olives, cheese, tea, and coffee.  In the case of Day 2 morning, it also came with the company of Gail and tips about routes to take into Petra :) Bonus was meeting her incredibly generous and gracious husband, Ibrahim, who was fake offended we hadn’t visited him at his restaurant the night prior and insisted we come (indeed he offered us free dinner or at the very least free tea nd sweets).

I was moving a little slowly due to jet lag etc, but we were out and on our way by 8:15 and walking up to the gate by 8:30, Jordan pass in hand. (Great time saver was buying a tourism pass in advance that included a visa if you stayed more than three nights and admission to various sites including Petra.) The walk into Petra was beautiful, though a bit of a project dodging all the tour groups.  The way the rock comes in on both sides and curves around is nothing short of graceful (I’m sure that one or two of the pictures will do it enough justice to give a feeling for what I’m talking about).

The treasury was quite impressive, though a different scene with people and camels and donkeys and vendors and horses and carriages. I wanted to capture the sounds as well as the visual, but I was never quite fast enough to whip out a recording device to get audio of the cacophony.  Seriously, it sounded like a Star Wars movie.

On our way down we came across a woman sitting on a rock practicing the flute and while we resisted her urging to act as our guide on a side trip to our side trip, Kevin did agree to a cup of Arab coffee (they cook the coffee in the water and add cardamom, a bit like Turkish coffee as I recall) and we sat on a rock and heard about her 20 siblings, including a sister named Libya, and four children.

Coffee finished, we got going and explored our way down the mountain, poking our heads into caves and losing and finding the path from time to time (as you do ;)). We finally popped back out on the main road near some Roman ruins (that we would visit later in an almost state of exhausted delirium) and after a quick bite (a very disappointing sandwich—can’t win ‘em all) started up the path toward the monastery.  The trail to the monastery was a bit nose-to-tail, but the monastery itself was worth the effort.  It was HUGE!  Probably you’ve seen the picture of me in front of it at this point, but in our JFS (Jordan For Scale) approach to contextualizing the world, let’s just say, I wasn’t even as tall as the sign in front of the entrance. It’s amazing that they carved structures like this, and how well preserved they are.

We continued past the monastery to the first unofficial view, advertised as “the best view in the world.” Nice, but we would beg to differ because the second view (advertised as “the best view in Petra”) was even better.  We sat on stools at this guy’s tent drinking sweet tea with mint and as we were sitting there the sun streamed through this gap in the clouds lighting up a mosque on a mountain a few mountains away.  Honestly, it was something to just sit and take in the sheer verticality (I don’t even think goats could take this on) of the surrounding cliffs.  The guy said that we could see as far as Israel, albeit way in the distance.

A quick look at the time and we were on our way back down the hill. At this point it was starting to hit me that my body had no earthly idea what time it was, but it had been going a long time.  We perused a few stalls (they were everywhere on the trail, no matter how far you thought you had gotten away from civilization, there was always someone around the corner trying to sell you a rock or a necklace or a scarf), but mostly motored down.  I mentioned the delirious stop at the Roman ruins, but besides that, we forced the left-foot-then-right-foot paradigm to just get ourselves to the car as quickly as possible.  By the time we got out we had hiked 11 miles, which I’ll call a solid day.

We checked into our hotel (no where near as nice as Gail and Ibrahim’s place) and then waited for hot water.  The down time was welcome (we forced ourselves to stay awake) but we were happy when it was time to head to Ibrahim’s restaurant, My Mom’s Recipe :) Delicious!  We had a mixed grill plate and some chicken dish with rice, hummus, guava juice and a fresh lemon-mint juice, followed by tea and sweets (a solid baklava move) sitting on an enclosed terrace heated by gas heaters and festively decorated with all kinds of fabric (it was pleasantly quiet too, come to think of it—all absorptive surfaces so that probably shouldn’t be a surprise).  I wish we had taken a picture of the restaurant itself, but at least Kevin got one of the spread.

Calling it there.  Everything else was a blur of getting to sleep.

## Day 3

Hi all,

“Why are you awake at 5:11 a.m.?” You ask? Very fair question. “Because on top of the chorus (kind term for it) of roosters, at 5 a.m. there was a cacophony of ten minute calls to prayer from every mosque in Giza over loud speaker”

Day 3
Day 3 found us with grand intentions of getting up and out by 7:30 to beat the crowds too, but functional plans to enjoy our breakfast on the enclosed roof terrace of our hotel (similar spread as with Gail, though less charming), amassing our gear and getting out the door in time to be on the trail (foregoing the “salami sandwich” this time) by 8:15 prevailed.  Not bad—we missed most of the large tour groups from the day before—but not the empty Treasury we had thought might be coming our way. C’est la vie; what do you gain, what do you lose? 11 miles and 30 minutes.  I’ll take it.

We were on a mission to see the Roman tombs.  It went something like this: scramble down the path to the treasury, head to the right to the tombs, scramble up a first round of stairs. Oh my, what a view. Scramble up more stairs to a tomb. Good heavens, did you see that ceiling?! (You’ll see the picture, it looked like some sort of highly textured weaving, though in fairness it’s not super obvious looking at the picture that it’s a ceiling.) Discuss the potential value of several small objects with stall owner, conclude we don’t like him or his prices. Walk past half a dozen more stalls. Climb more stairs. Man, did you see that view behind us? (The views behind us were of the main road spilling out past the amphitheater toward the mountains (I’m not sure what constitutes a mountain to be honest, but these were notably less gentle than hills and required hiking to get into, so we’ll go with it for now) where the monastery is. The layers of rock and all their texture alone would have been notable, and  adding the various structures carved into the rock made the view that much more intricate.) Did you see the texture in the rock steps? Thank goodness they didn’t deem it necessary to throw concrete over those like they did a few a ways down—traction be damned, beauty for the win! (We believe, in an effort to increase traction for tourists where steps had been eroded by years of wear and wind and water, some tourist organization added a concrete layer to the top) Climb more stairs. (Noticing a pattern?) Oh, now we’re getting somewhere... sigh, photo? Click, click, click. (That was the click of the camera as we tried to capture the verticality of the treasury looking down from above) Scramble... etc At this point, I encourage you to look at the photos.  I will only add that (1) we saw a full sized Pepsi cooler abandoned at the top of the mountain and can’t imagine how it came to be there and (2) we saw two guys with a donkey hauling four bags of trash and the donkey was weaving across the path back and forth, occasionally scraping one of the bags against the rocks and Kevin had me in fits anthropomorphizing it—ask him about it sometime. We did a little shopping during our scramble down and out of Petra, but mostly we were on a mission to get in the car and off to Wadi Rum, so we will pick up our story there...

We only got stopped once by the police on our way to Wadi Rum (valley of light, airborne sand)! We were running a bit late, so by the time we arrived we were in a rush, but it still ended up being a wild exciting ride of an afternoon.  Where you ask, were we headed, really?  Right, so Wadi Rum is a nature preserve in the south of Jordan not far from the Saudi Arabian border.  On our drive to Wadi Musa from Amman, at the recommendation of enough random people, we decided to cancel our second night at the Rocky Mountain Hotel in Wadi Musa and opt to make the 2 hour drive south to take a 2 ish hour Jeep ride through the preserve, a 2 ish hour ride on camel and a night in a tent at a Bedouin camp.  (I’ll give credit where credit is due though, it was Gail who did the dirty work of cancelling our second night at the hotel and made arrangements for our tours and stay at Khaled’s Camp—have I mentioned that she was great?) We scrambled a bit, trying to make sure we ended up with the right people (Gail said we shouldn’t advertise who we were looking for in case they offered to be whomever we named), but soon we were in the right Jeep (for some loose definition of Jeep—I believe it was actually a Toyota) and off on Mr. Toad’s wild ride.

What an experience... You’ll see some pictures of each of us with hair flying back as we sped along (the young guy driving was very skilled) and I’ll tell you that I probably took an order of magnitude more pictures than survived due to the uneven terrain ;) But to add a few extra words, it was, an expanse.  This wide open space of subtly varying red sand topography punctuated by sandstone outcroppings in the hours just before sunset.  We would stop every so often to scramble (our young intrepid driver as tickled by my name being Jordan and would send us off with, “Go Jordan! GO!”) up some rock for a view or to view some old inscription on some rock (in truth, the view from the ground wasn’t that different from the view from the top  because it was all of a huge expanse and a 100 feet of vertical doesn’t move the needle on your perspective much, but the scrambles were fun in their own rights) but my favorite part was the ride :) We did eventually make it to the spot our driver had in mind for the sunset and after s few unannounced and unexplained stops—literally he stopped without explanation, reversed, smiled, parked, but didn’t beckon us—to gather pieces of brush and rocks, it became clear that the sunset watching plan involved Bedouin tea. We still don’t understand why he chose to make the fire on the other side of the vehicle from the sunset such that we couldn’t drink tea while we sun go down, but as it turns out he struggled with the fire starting anyway (resourceful fellow though, eventually pulled a little gasoline from the car to help things along) so sunset and tea happened sequentially anyway.

You’ll see the picture of our tent, but the important thing to know was that one wall of it was window so we could look out of our bed where we were under a pile of blankets and see the stars. Our dinner was cooked underground, so just prior to dinner we saw chicken, potatoes, vegetable stew, and rice emerge from the ground on a multi level set of trays. (Not only was dinner delicious, but bonus for Jordan-the-vegetable-enthusiast was the lovely cucumber and tomato salad and the yogurt cucumber sauce :)) After dinner we sat around taking with the other guests (two couples from Bavaria traveling separately, a woman from San Francisco, and a fellow who works in the UAE with plans to retire soon with his kids and grandkids outside of Boulder) and took a wander to look at the stars.

That’s a wrap for now, time to head back to sleep (hopefully).

P.S. I’m in an arm wrestling match with Google photos so the majority of mine may not show up until we stumble acrosss reliable internet.

## Day 4

 Day 4

Armed with new knowledge of my camera (I didn’t get into it, but I spent some time pouring over the French manual for my camera and trying different combinations of buttons and settings until I figured out how to manually adjust the exposure on Day 3 night) we woke up at 5:20 to watch the sunrise from the warmth of bed :).  Beautiful. We could see hikers on the rock in the distance, and I felt a twinge of “I should be out there” but I also embraced the decadence of our window wall without much trouble. After breakfast we spent two hours on camels traveling back to our car. Heh. It’s possible two hours was an hour too many, but camels are ridiculous creatures and not something we can do everyday, so I reckon it’s good we got our fill.  Check out the video clips to get a taste of how awkward it is getting up and down ;).

All but one sandal (sorry to report that) met us at our car, and we started off for the Dead Sea. We had not expected a scenic drive particularly as the prior drives had been a bit hit-or-miss, but this one had some mighty fine vistas and an early sighting of Israel and the Dead Sea. (For those keeping score at home, we were stopped by police once on our drive to our swimming spot and the policeman tried to get us to take on a couple of hitchhikers, but happily didn’t push very hard. Our final total is 5.)
I may have driven Kevin a little nuts as I played name-that-vegetable as we drove by field after field and stand after stand, but he didn’t say anything; what a gentleman!

The Dead Sea did not disappoint. For 15 JOD each we got an hour to change, race down to the beach, play in the water, shower and get back on our way. You all thought I might leave it at that...ha! But seriously, the Dead Sea was really neat. We found that not only could we float high enough in the water without effort to read a newspaper, but we could also be upright with shoulders clearly above the waterline without treading water! We covered ourselves with mud so I’m guessing there was definitely a Benjamin Button thing going, or would have been had we not aged several years driving through traffic into Amman...

Back in the car, I started scrambling to find some place to eat.  Pushed by the desire to have a glass of wine with dinner, I  stumbled across a highly rated Lebanese restaurant and—bless him—Kevin was down.  We did finally struggle through rush hour traffic in and around Amman and make our way to the hotel. I kid you not though, we saw cars go the wrong way in open lanes of traffic only to push their ways back in at the end of the street. I did my best with google maps to try to keep the pain to a minimum, but props to Kevin for taking Jordanian driving by the horns.

We did eventually make it to the hotel (I’m pretty sure that the last 300 meters took 6 minutes), showered properly (I’m also pretty sure it will take multiple showers to get all the salt off and probably a washing machine to get our bathing suits back to pre DS condition), and hit the streets (on foot!) on our way to dinner.  We paused awkwardly as we arrived at the restaurant, unclear about whether they would take us in our blue jeans and without a reservation (I think they were unclear too because they also paused, looked at each other, left, came back, conferred) but they eventually took us to a table in a room off the main room and what followed was delightful.  Our waiter, a fellow from Damascus with family in Oklahoma, refused to let us serve ourselves and at his hands (and those of this little man who would leap in and deposit hit puts on our bread plates) we had fattoush, hummus, a shawarma pie, a mixed grill plate and wine followed by candied fruits (pomelo peal, fig, apricot) and a huge fruit bowl (see photo to understand why we howled with laughter when he brought it). Anyway, it was an entire meal of swallows, smiles, and giggles as one of us after another tried to do something polite or enjoy something. As we walked back we passed a Bank of Jordan and discussed whether it would be worth the foreign transaction fees to have such an atm card...

As I sit here, impressively full, in the common room of the Sydney Hotel (somewhere between a hotel and a hostel) I can still feel the spot on my chin where the water made contact.  The Dead Sea is quite a place. The camels are impressively awkward creatures. Tomorrow, like today, is likely to take my breath away.  Again.

Until next time (and hopefully for sometime after that, but anyway),

## Day 5

Day 5

There’s a song that has a line “I woke up in a car” and for whatever reason everytime Kevin and I talk about the morning of Day 5 it starts with “we woke up in Amman”... the weird things that happen in brains, eh?

Breakfast was not the production that dinner on Night 4 was (and thank goodness), but was enjoyable and with it I experienced the second positive interaction with my camera (it’s been a nightmare getting photos from my camera to my phone to google photos) whereby it actually wirelessly transmitted all the camel photos (among others) when I asked it to, and on the first try! But I diverge...

We packed up and headed out to a Roman amphitheater. We had heard it was neat, and only had time for a short jaunt, so we wove speedily along the sewing machine street which gave way to women’s clothing street and eventually a street or two with less commercial specificity. I kid you not though, there was a solid block of stores that specialized in sewing machines! Not exactly a surprise given we had walked a pet food block the night before on our way to dinner. We arrived at the amphitheater and proudly produced our Jordan passes (we were pleased that they were getting us into yet another site), and the man at the entrance took each of them, turned them over, folded them and purposefully stamped them... with his hand that did not contain a stamp :) We were tickled by the joking formality of this ritual, as we believe, was he. The amphitheater was quite impressive. You’ve probably seen the photos by this point, but I’m pretty sure the pitch was such that there were not bad seats in that house.

It was a speedy visit because we were in a once-burned-thrice-shy mentality when it came to Amman traffic and wanted to make sure we returned the rental car and got to the airport on time. As it happens, when we got back to the hotel we found we had a bonus 40 minutes so we poked around nearby stores for a while (picked up a couple of Jordan mugs ;)) before heading out. You’ve already heard about traffic in Amman, but I’ll add here that we came across a recurring traffic structure that involved a round about with an underpass straightaway.

Things went smoothly at the airport and aside from an unexpected flight path that avoided flying over or near Israel and an unexpected meal (a meal on a flight with only an hour fly time?!) there was nothing to write home about...as they say. We landed in Cairo and bought our visa stamps in U.S. dollars which was both handy because we hadn’t exchanged money yet, and interesting because it turns out they don’t accept local currency. I got stopped briefly at immigration for reasons we don’t understand (possibly something about my many names? Never know about these things, particularly with a language barrier) and then we headed to baggage claim where I fumbled around between “I forgot my password” and 2-factor authentication text messages (15 seconds is *barely* enough to get a text from Uber with a code and enter it, it turns out) trying to login to the Uber app (I had deleted it all together after the Uber stories came out, but for some reason I had reinstalled it, so at least we had that going for us). Fending off taxi drivers, we found our way to the B5 parking sign and to our ride.

Ah, the ride. How do I do Cairo rush hour justice? There was even less adherence to lane lines and much more honking than Jordan (even during rush hour in Amman). That seems superficial though in comparison to the unpaved road connections and exits, people selling things in traffic, vehicles broken down everywhere and people milling about...and that was the freeway! The roads near the pyramids featured horses and rickshaws and camels as well a s the regular slough of pedestrians and taxis. Bonus was that our hotel is new, so nobody knows where it is, and was actually located down a dirt lane and around a corner in a place that a car couldn’t possibly have reached, so you can imagine that figuring that out and with a language barrier went about as smoothly as medium grade sand paper. A couple of people from the hotel came out to the last landmark (a Chinese food restaurant) and showed us the rest of the way.

But! The roof terrace (not enclosed this time) had a fantastic view of the pyramids so after we had put down our stuff, we headed upstairs for what turned out to be a couple of HORRIBLE beers and a GREAT view of the sound and light show put on every night. Though intimidated by the twisting and turning streets and complicated social rules of the immediate part of world outside our hotel, we ventured out for dinner and enjoyed a fancy meal (Hummus, baba ganoush, pita, soup, salad, eggplant thing, chicken kabab, lamb and rice) for $16.

Signing off for now,

## Day 6 
Tl;dr: we walked 10.5 miles and both left and safely returned to our hotel with quite a day of Cairo in the interim.

In case you do want to read however, here goes...

We woke up at 3 to the sound of roosters.
We woke up at 4 to the sound of roosters.
We woke up at 5 to the sound of roosters... and the call to morning prayer coming from multiple audiologically conflicting mosques simultaneously.  The cacophony went on a solid 15 minutes.  There are people in this town with nontrivial lung capacity.
Stayed awake to more roosters... and a duck!  (We envisioned all of them standing facing Mecca)
Drifted but woke up at 6:20 to more roosters and Kevin’s alarm so that we could go watch the rising sun spill light across the pyramids.  It ended up being beautiful (though highly filtered by the pollution that hangs over Cairo), albeit cold, and we found out that the roosters and duck (actually, ducks, it turned out there were more that had apparently held their peace earlier), and a goat were actually on nearby rooftops, which may explain the volume we experienced in our third floor room.  (Incidentally, the rooms are numbered from high to low, so our room on the third floor was 103.) The sun soundly up, we went back our room and enjoyed lovely warm showers (hot water has not been as available here as it is at home) and headed back up to the roof to enjoy breakfast with a view.  (Incidentally the roosters were still going.  We’re thinking it’s an “it’s sunrise somewhere” mentality...)

We caught an Uber from  the Chinese restaurant to the subway station and managed to procure two train tickets (25 cents each from a guy at a window—there are no automatic kiosks so everyone without a monthly pass of some kind has to stand in line).  Happily it was the end of the line so hard to go the wrong direction, and we crowded into the car.  So many men.  For the Milner family, Jaden might offer that there was “too much boys!”.  I felt a bit conspicous without a head covering... right, and being blond haired and blue eyed, but I kept my head mostly down just in case and Kevin kept me close and some time later we arrived at the Egyptian Museum without incident.

We spent a couple-few hours wandering—let’s call it wading—through Egyptian aritfacts.  The place is everything people say it is: impressive, densely packed with objects that are mostly unlabeled, and when one happens to be, the label is quite literal with no particular context and was produced on a type writer, and filled with tourists. Let’s go back to the impressive part for a moment though because it deserves mention that we saw Tutankhamen’s head piece in a glass case in the middle of a room that we almost missed and it really is impressive.  We also saw a number of mummies which was interesting, though made me a bit queasy to be honest.

After perusing the Egyptian Museum, we walked down the Nile across a bridge and back over to train station. It was only a loop, but fun to be able to say we’ve seen the Nile!

Back to tales of food... After our Nile detour, we undertook crossing Tahrir Square... which is to say we opted to go through security and back into the subway passages in order to cross the street.  Heh.  We made our way to  a restaurant called Koshari El Tahrir that was recommended by a friend Kevin made at the workshop he attended in Saudi Arabia prior to (and the impetuous for) our trip.  I don’t think I’ve ever been to a restaurant where the only choice is do you want “small”, “medium”, or “large”.  But here we were. For $1.50, we got two small (and small constituted a very reasonable lunch portion) bowls of a pasta-rice combination with a tomato sauce and lentils and fried onions (I neatly dodged them, though not the onions in the dish—c’est la vie) with hot sauce.  Delicious.

So we talked about the challenges of traveling by Uber, but after lunch we tried our hand (feet?) at walking around.  There aren’t really crosswalks, and not many lights, so (given traffic) you cross the street by weaving through slowly moving (sometimes even stopped cars).  It felt a little like being in a video game, weaving among vendors and sidewalk shops, crossing streets with some sort of meditative fluidity (and a fair dose of courage).

I do want to say that Kevin was awesome all day.  At one point I was thanking him for watching my back and making sure I was safe, and I will paraphrase slightly, but basically his response was, “well, I try to remember that the experience that a small, blond, blue eyed female is having may be less comfortable than my own.” Seriously, he was right there all the way and I felt the freedom to look around a bit and make eye contact with the women I saw from time to time and take in the sites as we wizzed by (we tend to walk fast).

On our way to the Bazar we navigated small streets, big streets, side streets, small markets in the middle of intersections and a stretch of women’s clothing that was stall after stall  on a pedestrian street for at least half a mile. Clothes were hanging above us several dresses high and piled up on tables in front of store fronts (the stores were very shallows so most of the business happens on the walkway). Upon arrival, we wandered the bazar for a while, poking our heads in places to look at leather slippers and silver jewelry, several types of scarves and mother of pearl inlaid boxes.  What we didn’t do was take too many pictures so you’ll have to trust us on this one mostly.  Neat scene though, and once we were there we both felt much more at ease, so we were able to enjoy it, despite all the people trying to get our attention.

We paused outside Al-Hussein Mosque for a bit to collect ourselves and then made our way to Al-Azhar Park.  What a relief it was to walk through the greenery and spend time under trees; for a bit less than a dollar each we found respite from the madness of Cairo. We shared a couple of ice cream bars and roamed. Per the usual, nothing was that simple though. It started with one. A woman walked up to us and asked if we would be in a picture with her. Surprised, but happy to help, we agreed. Then a little ways down the path we’re approached by a group of girls, each of whom it seemed wanted a picture or two either taken by a friend or as a selfie, some solo and some as a gaggle. We stopped on a hill to look out and finish our ice creams and continued wandering. I would guess that we took north of 20 photos    with probably two dozen kids who approached us from the front, the back, the back running around in front of us—we developed a finely honed sense for the approach of children.

I’ve learned that the promise of unlimited 2G data is limited to a small selection of areas with outdated networks. This hasn’t been s huge deal, but in Cairo we have leaned on Uber and were trying to meet up with an acquaintance of Kevin’s from KAUST, so I’ve been running around looking for old 3G network like one might use a Geiger counter to characterize radiation. Long story short, 3G didn’t come through for us in the park and we were left with getting s cab to take us to the train station. Of course the cab got going the wrong way/long way and only because of Kevin’s fanatical perusing and some very forceful words did we end up at a, but also not quite the right, subway station. Regardless, we found the right train and rode to the transfer station. I’ll pause here to say that this account wouldn’t be complete if I didn’t mention that a random guy on the train first moved over to give me a space by the handrail, but then also reached out when I wasn’t looking and started feeling my butt. It took me s minute to realize what was happening (it was a crowded train) and then to glare at him and shortly thereafter book it off the train. Kevin was possibly more appalled than I was (I guess some part of me was mentally prepared? Ugh), but gentle and protective and concerned in a way that did help with the feeling of being violated.

We made it to Maaudi where we met Hany and enjoyed quite a spread of classic Egyptian dishes and stories of his family and the village where he grew up (and invited us to visit). After dinner we popped down the street for sugar cane juice and then back to the train.

In keeping with the search for 3G, we got off at Giza, realized the network was updated, and took the train to the end of the line where I thought I had found some 3G in the morning. Success! Well, kind of. I was able to call an Uber, we were able to cross the street, but—just our luck—the driver didn’t know how to use the Uber app. Oy. We scrambled around trying to find s place in the map written in Arabic so that he could know where he was going (our trusty Chinese Restaurant did not come through for us on this one).

Anyway, we did eventually make it home, so tomorrow will be another day.

## Day 7

Last one for this trip! You’re in the home stretch!

We woke up at 1:42 a.m. to try check in for our flights from Cairo to Moscow and Moscow to JFK/LAX (J/K respectively) and were met with an error message saying we weren’t allowed to because our initial departure airport was Cairo. Right, “so what?” you ask? It’s southwest style and we weren’t allowed to choose seats in advance, so we were left in suspense all day wondering if we would both have middle seats for s 1:45 a.m. flight. A key part of surviving our flight combinations had been that Kevin would sleep on the window, and I would sleep on Kevin, so this added some bonus anxiety about surviving serious exhaustion as well as some grumpiness about having woken up unnecessarily at 1:42 a.m.. Boffo!

We only briefly woke up at 5 to the call for prayers and the roosters (I, for one, had earplugs this time around, and Kevin usually sleeps with a pillow over his head and the combination was more effective on this occasion than the prior) and properly woke up at 6:45 to shower, pack, and eat so that we could be out and dodging people hiring themselves out as guides at the pyramids entrance by 8:20. Having seen the pyramids several times from the guest house rooftop, we were familiar with the site, but as we walked up, it was still jarring how big they are. There are a few JFS (Jordan-for-scale) pictures as well as plenty of each of us with them, but just consider that each block came up a bit above my waist when I was standing against them and they are MANY blocks high.

We sort of accidentally (and sort of not accidentally) let a guy take pictures of us (who we then of course had to tip), but the pictures were good—if a bit cheesy—so in the end it seemed worth it. For a few bucks we also got to go in and take pictures of the inside of one of the smaller pyramids. I don’t think we got a picture of the ladder, but it was some long boards backing some cross rungs and you kind of lowered yourself into this chute one step at a time with each hand on a well worn banister because there were only about three feet (maybe fewer?) of clearance so no option for standing up. Back up the ladder, we tipped the guy who had let us in (as we had known we would have to), but then another guy looked at us expectantly, so he got a dollar as well. (Shout out to the guy in my yoga class who I had never met—surprising given how rarely we get new comers—who overheard me talking and told me to bring plenty of $1 bills for tipping in Egypt. Without that intel we would have had a very different experience.)

Once more into the wide open world, we wandered over to the largest pyramid and I think were only intercepted by one group of school children and one pair of camels (one gawked at us, one was gawked at by us). We walked around taking pictures and admiring the construction. The parallel-ness of the edges when you line up the sequence of pyramids is very pleasing, as is the way the lines are simultaneously clean but the sides textured.

You’ll see the pictures, if you haven’t already (and eventually google will let me upload mine...maybe), but the next hour or so was a combination of taking in the size of the pyramids, the perspective, the way the light played the geometry, dodging and agreeing to be in photos with groups of girls, and moseying through the sequence and toward the road going up the sand dune that offers a view of all three together with Cairo in the background.

However, we did take a detour to one of the small adjacent pyramids where the rocks were smaller because Kevin has a hankering to climb. Climbing was not ideal for me with my many layers and my big camera (thank goodness I got the neoprene wrap for it), but not to be left behind, I clambered yo behind him. We were just about st the top and I had snagged a couple of pictures of Kevin when we heard people starting to yell. Right, so it wasn’t exactly kosher that we were climbing. This pyramids wasn’t roped off like the others, but we were pushing the rules a fair ways to have tried to take to the sky on this one. So we clambered down. The tourist police gave us a real runaround and yelled at us and insisted we delete any pictures. I showed them as I deleted photos from my camera, hoping I might buffer anything Kevin had snapped on his phone and deflected enough that we walked away only down my pictures, and hearts racing. The guys softened up a bit as we asked a couple more questions about how to get places, but still, definitely walked away with hearts racing. Bummer that after all that Kevin only got a couple of selfies of himself that don’t really show the pyramid and no vague evidence at all that I was there, but it’s good we didn’t get into any more trouble than that.

We made our way up that road to the sand dune behind to take our side shots and then made our way down for a look at the Sphinx. I should have counted the number of photos we took with kids, because our way down was thick with them. Eventually I tapped out because my patience had been sapped by the police encounter. Kevin entertainer a few more, but after a quick look at the Sphinx from behind a gate, we arrived at the bottom of our hill, tour complete.

Now for the open question of what to do with our afternoon. It was a conundrum because there isn’t much to do in Giza outside the pyramids, but there also isn’t really a “casual jaunt” version of “visiting Cairo after the pyramids” that we had been able to find. We ended up burning the afternoon chasing WiFi and lurking in the hotel. At some point it started raining sporadically and got cold, at some point we ventured out for a snack, but mostly we moved between lurking in the room by the entryway, the roof deck (uncovered though, so not ideal), and the stairwell (until we got the WiFi password for downstairs). I caught up on these emails a bit, we both fought with google photos, Kevin learned about the Moscow airport, and eventually we shared another bad beer (at this point we speculated that it may bd the worst beer in Cairo, but possibly also the best beer in Cairo, and also the only beer we had ever seen with Arabic writing on it) on the roof, changed and headed out.

So Day 6 night was supposed to include a Nile dinner cruise, but after the no-data/no-Uber fiasco turned into s logistical nightmare, we scrapped that plan in favor of postponing the dinner cruise for Day 7 night when we would have time to kill and no place to kill it. So we arrived at the dinner cruise at 6:49 without a reservation for a 7:45 cruise, bags in hand. This seemed to be an unusual situation for them, but they actually took it quite well. I think Kevin got a little more rigor, but the guy who pawed through my bags did so very gingerly (I think he didn’t want to risk encountering a foreign woman’s underwear—not in his job description of checking purses and cell phones and running a metal detector). I waited with the bags in the increasing drizzle (the dinner cruise is inside) while Kevin successfully procured tickets and then they graciously arranged for us to board early do we wouldn’t have to sit in the rain and found us a place in the corner (it was perfect—we could see everything in the room but had more window access and a ledge where we could store our bags!).

Amusingly, the meal was almost over by the time we left the dock. Meal was meh, to be honest, but the excursion had guaranteed us a warm, dry place to be for three hours and something to eat, so we’ll give the memorably horrible chocolate cake a by. We did encounter some much more decent Egyptian beer which was both good, but also meant we could laugh about the other beer being the worst and possibly the best ;) the dinner entertainment included some singers and a belly dancer and a whirling dervish of sorts (I believe) and by 10:10 we were back at the dock. Importantly, having decided that perhaps we could extend the list of places we are willing to travel to to include those with ducks in addition to those with sheep (a thesis that came from our trip to Scotland).

The rain has gotten very intense st points during our float on the Nile and we were pleased to find it relatively abated by the time we disembarked. We got a guy in the office to let us use his phone as a mobile hotspot to call an Uber and headed upstairs. We eventually found the car but having lost the connection prior to locating the car (mobile hotspot still with the guy in the office) when we got in the car we ended up having to operate outside the Uber infrastructure and pay the guy way more than we should have (though less than LA and about half his asking price—$50?? Ha!).

It didn’t turn out to be a horrible ordeal, but our not-Uber dropped us at the wrong terminal and we briefly thought we were going to have to pay another person a small amount of money to take us where we needed to go. But as usual, Kevin was scouring google maps and gave us enough confidence that terminal 2 was nearby that we skipped the tourist tax and walked.

At this point Kevin had begun laughing nonspecifically about the madness that is Cairo and chuckled that every new hiccup was a conspiracy against me because it meant more words in this email.

Well, let me tell you that I just went through security for the third time. Once to get to check-in (water was allowed through that one and electronics didn’t have to be removed), again after immigration (special line for Moscow in which they tore apart all of our bags and we sat in a forest of metal detector plastic boxes repacking the clown car of a duffel that contains 90% of our souvenirs and some dirty laundry to pad it) and a third time before the gate (there were six people—four men, two women—taking apart bags, swiping electronics and humans for explosives residue and doing pat downs/metal detection wanding). I think that will be all, but what’s an extra few more security checks between friends?

A couple of final addendums:
I should mention that metal detectors are everywhere, not just the airport in Egypt. We came across them going into museums, hotels, the subway...they are variably staffed and attended to, but the infra structure is there.

I will probably steer clear of Aeroflot in the future. The Moscow airport was actually pleasant enough, and happily we did not have to go through several more rounds of security, but both flights left late for reasons that were not explained (and non-negligible late: 40 and 60 minutes respectively), the movie selection was mostly unrecognizable, the food was notably bad, and there wasn’t any alcohol on the plane. It’s not do much that wine on planes is delicious, but rather having a glass of wine lends an air of bonus civility that makes me feel less like part of a cattle herd (which makes the comment about “steering clear” ever more apt).  The leg room is a little bit more than average though, so that’s compelling, and the flight wasn’t full, which is always good.

That wraps it up for this trip! I’ll be landing in JFK shortly and Kevin in LA a few hours later. Kevin will of course play a gig tonight (because he’s crazy), and I’ll see my folks with my dad flying in  tomorrow and the three of us trooping over to see the new Harry Potter plays on Saturday (part 1 and 2). I’m back next Wednesday (meeting up with Kevin and some other earth scientist friends in DC for a couple of days at an annual conference prior to return), and hope to see you all around soon!
