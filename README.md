Tales of our trip to Jordan and Egypt


## Day 1
Hi all,  

In the spirit of the Scotland emails, here’s the newest from the travel log...  

What a place... (we’ll start there and I’ll back it up with some words and a few pictures that vaguely do it justice). 

A few notes about airplane travel:  
If you fly into O’Hare and land in, say, terminal 2, and need to get to terminal 5, you will need to run—and I mean run— to gate C17 and hope that the bus will be arriving soon enough to give you enough time to cross the tarmac. If this is not the case, the lady will unapologetically tell you that “you are going to miss your flight.” Happily I was on one of the few flights with timing such that I squeaked by with 15 minutes to spare having /booked it/ from the bus to the gate. Anyway...  

I did make all my flights (LA-Chicago-Vienna-Amman) and through immigration and found Kevin waiting at the bottom of the escalator to give me a big hug (also, points to him for explaining literally every part of the process of going through immigration). We eventually found our way to the rental car company, were given a Nissan Sunny (not nearly so friendly as little Argo from Scotland) with considerably less hassle than in Scotland, and hit the road.  

You’ll see from the pictures that lane lines are a flexible topic here. Take moment to try to parse what they might mean. (Our host last night informed us that people drive in the lanes...unless the shoulder is paved better, and then they drive there instead.) Once upon a time there was an improv comedy show called “Who’s line is it anyway?” With a tag phrase “where the rules are made up and the points don’t matter.” We (mostly Kevin’s creative genius) came up with “Who’s lane is it anyways? Where the police stop you randomly and the lines don’t matter.” Ever the trooper, Kevin did the lane juggle and 2.5 hours later he and my jet lagged self arrived at our Airbnb.  

We made a game-time decision to try to get Petra by Night tickets, so within the hour we were off again hunting an ATM, dinner and tickets. Wins all around and we chowed down on sandwiches as we walked toward Petra for the first time.  

Magical. With the path was lit in both sides with luminaria (candies sitting in sand inside bags—makes for glowing bags) and a big of a moon, we made our way through the canyon toward the Treasury. I’ll admit we were not quite, but almost, the last ones there because I was fumbling with lenses and camera settings (in the dark!) trying to capture some of it, but made it we did. We sat there under the stars listening to first a guy playing a really old bowed string instrument I can’t remember the name of, and then a flutist. After the concert they lit up the Treasury. When we walked in the entire area in front was doted with the luminaria but the spots of light on the ground didn’t illuminate the actual carving well. Anyway, have a look at the pictures, that will do it more justice than I can.  

That wraps up my first fraction of a day in Jordan.  

As usual, I’m a day behind, but The Short Version of today is: our Airbnb host was amazing, hiking Petra was literally an awesome (as in, inspired awe) 11 mile experience (I’m exhausted—bone tired from hiking and jet lag), and dinner at the Airbnb host’s husband’s restaurant was delicious and delightful—he is also a notably gracious host.  

I may send stories from today tomorrow, but they may just get wrapped into picture captions. (I’m a little behind posting pictures too, but here’s where they’ll be:

## Day 2
Dear world,

Last we spoke I had given you the tldr on day two... which could be mostly explained by the fact that Friday was spent hiking 11 miles on a brain full of adrenaline and jet lag. Let’s see if we can do it more justice than that.

Day 2
Mmmmmm breakfast here is great :) Yogurt and apricot jam, za’atar and labneh and pita, cucumbers, tomatoes, eggs, olives, cheese, tea, and coffee.  In the case of Day 2 morning, it also came with the company of Gail and tips about routes to take into Petra :) Bonus was meeting her incredibly generous and gracious husband, Ibrahim, who was fake offended we hadn’t visited him at his restaurant the night prior and insisted we come (indeed he offered us free dinner or at the very least free tea nd sweets).

I was moving a little slowly due to jet lag etc, but we were out and on our way by 8:15 and walking up to the gate by 8:30, Jordan pass in hand. (Great time saver was buying a tourism pass in advance that included a visa if you stayed more than three nights and admission to various sites including Petra.) The walk into Petra was beautiful, though a bit of a project dodging all the tour groups.  The way the rock comes in on both sides and curves around is nothing short of graceful (I’m sure that one or two of the pictures will do it enough justice to give a feeling for what I’m talking about). The treasury was quite impressive, though a different scene with people and camels and donkeys and vendors and horses and carriages. I wanted to capture the sounds as well as the visual, but I was never quite fast enough to whip out a recording device to get audio of the cacophony.  Seriously, it sounded like a Star Wars movie.

Our first side hike was up to the high place of sacrifice which featured views of the valley and the surrounding mountains.  On our way down we came across a woman sitting on a rock practicing the flute and while we resisted her urging to act as our guide on a side trip to our side trip, Kevin did agree to a cup of Arab coffee (they cook the coffee in the water and add cardamom, a bit like Turkish coffee as I recall) and we sat on a rock and heard about her 20 siblings, including a sister named Libya, and four children.  Coffee finished, we got going and explored our way down the mountain, poking our heads into caves and losing and finding the path from time to time (as you do ;)). We finally popped back out on the main road near some Roman ruins (that we would visit later in an almost state of exhausted delirium) and after a quick bite (a very disappointing sandwich—can’t win ‘em all) started up the path toward the monastery.  The trail to the monastery was a bit nose-to-tail, but the monastery itself was worth the effort.  It was HUGE!  Probably you’ve seen the picture of me in front of it at this point, but in our JFS (Jordan For Scale) approach to contextualizing the world, let’s just say, I wasn’t even as tall as the sign in front of the entrance. It’s amazing that they carved structures like this, and how well preserved they are.

We continued past the monastery to the first unofficial view, advertised as “the best view in the world.” Nice, but we would beg to differ because the second view (advertised as “the best view in Petra”) was even better.  We sat on stools at this guy’s tent drinking sweet tea with mint and as we were sitting there the sun streamed through this gap in the clouds lighting up a mosque on a mountain a few mountains away.  Honestly, it was something to just sit and take in the sheer verticality (I don’t even think goats could take this on) of the surrounding cliffs.  The guy said that we could see as far as Israel, albeit way in the distance.

A quick look at the time and we were on our way back down the hill. At this point it was starting to hit me that my body had no earthly idea what time it was, but it had been going a long time.  We perused a few stalls (they were everywhere on the trail, no matter how far you thought you had gotten away from civilization, there was always someone around the corner trying to sell you a rock or a necklace or a scarf), but mostly motored down.  I mentioned the delirious stop at the Roman ruins, but besides that, we forced the left-foot-then-right-foot paradigm to just get ourselves to the car as quickly as possible.  By the time we got out we had hiked 11 miles, which I’ll call a solid day.

We checked into our hotel (no where near as nice as Gail and Ibrahim’s place) and then waited for hot water.  The down time was welcome (we forced ourselves to stay awake) but we were happy when it was time to head to Ibrahim’s restaurant, My Mom’s Recipe :) Delicious!  We had a mixed grill plate and some chicken dish with rice, hummus, guava juice and a fresh lemon-mint juice, followed by tea and sweets (a solid baklava move) sitting on an enclosed terrace heated by gas heaters and festively decorated with all kinds of fabric (it was pleasantly quiet too, come to think of it—all absorptive surfaces so that probably shouldn’t be a surprise).  I wish we had taken a picture of the restaurant itself, but at least Kevin got one of the spread.

Calling it there.  Everything else was a blur of getting to sleep.
